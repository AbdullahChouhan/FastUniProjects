It's not fair... it shouldn't have had to end like this... I mean... how could I have known?... Mary Sue... that was the name in the tag hanging from her neck... she had been the one to do me in... one shot to the head while I was barely conscious... and now... my life as Tanya von Degurechaff is over... what now?

Where am I?

Am I falling somewhere?

Yes. It feels as if I'd be falling... I'm falling from the sky... the sky is red... and above me there is a five pointed star stretching all over me... and below... beneath me... I see the place I'm falling into... it looks like a set of buildings... some are tall ones... wait? a city? what is this place?
