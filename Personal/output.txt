It's not fair. It shouldn't have had to end like this. I mean. How could I have known?. Mary Sue. That was the name in the tag hanging from her neck. She had been the one to do me in. One shot to the head while I was barely conscious. And now. My life as Tanya von Degurechaff is over. What now?

Where am I?

Am I falling somewhere?

Yes. It feels as if I'd be falling. I'm falling from the sky. The sky is red. And above me there is a five pointed star stretching all over me. And below. Beneath me. I see the place I'm falling into. It looks like a set of buildings. Some are tall ones. Wait? a city? what is this place?
